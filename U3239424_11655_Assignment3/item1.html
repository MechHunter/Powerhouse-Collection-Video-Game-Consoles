    'Magnavox Odyssey' video game console
  </h2>
  <h3>Object No. 2014/5/1<br>1972</h3>
  <section>
    <p>
      The Magnavox Odyssey was the first ever video game system designed for televisions in the home and initiated the
      home TV game market.
      <br>
      It was designed over 1967-68 by Ralph Baer, an electrical engineer at Sanders Associates Inc. This digital console
      also has a working prototype housed at the Smithsonian Institute's National Museum of American History, along with
      his original planning and sketch notes. The prototype goes by the name 'The Brown Box.' It was used to demonstrate
      the first video games on a 19-inch television in a pitch by Sanders Associates to Magnavox in 1968.
      <br>
      The Magnavox Odyssey was first demonstrated to the public in early 1972 and was released for commercial sale in
      August of 1972, so it predated Atari's Pong console by at least three years. There are several iterations of the
      Odyssey console, including Pong versions and Odyssey2.

          The Magnavox Odyssey is the first video game digital console produced. It was invented and designed by Ralph Baer in 1967-68 in the United States of America.
          <br>
          It was produced and released for commercial sale by Magnavox in 1972 after a successful prototype was built and demonstrated to Magnavox known as the 'The Brown Box'. 
          <br>
          The commercial console, recognisable by black, white and brown plastic rather then the wood panelling of the prototype Brown Box, was later available across the UK, Europe and Japan between 1973-74. It was discontinued in 1975 due to poor marketing campaigns that had the general public believe the game consoles only worked with Magnavox televisions.
          <br>
          This has a digital console and two analoge controllers.</td>

          The Magnavox Odyssey was the first ever video game system designed for televisions in the home and initiated the home TV game market. 
          <br>
          12 original games were shipped with the Odyssey system purchased in 1972. The games were; Table tennis, Simon says, Submarine, Analogic, Haunted house, Roulette, States, Ski, Football, Cat and mouse, Hockey and Tennis.
          <br>
          The colourful plastic interface screens 'game overlays' were standard inclusions and were used for covering the television screen to augment the gaming experience. Two different sizes were provided. Various additional standard 'extras' included the game playing cards, plastic discs 'game chips', dice and a score card tallying home vs/ visitors.
          <br>
          This set is missing the following items normally included in the standard game; football token, yardage marker, card No. 18 from 'Haunted House' game cards, 1 pass card from the 'Football' game cards, and six Magnavox batteries.</td>
